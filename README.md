## Project

This project is an implementation of a React table component, which accepts columns and data as a props. The table always keeps the last column visible as well as allows to sort rows by specific column.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

NOTE: This is my first time using styled-components. I normally use Sass.

## How to run locally

To run this project in your local environment you need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) of version 10 or greater installed. 

After cloning or downloading this repo, run (in main directory):

### `npm install`

Then, still in main directory, run:

### `npm run start`

That command should open browser window with the application running. If the browser window doesn't open itself then open browser manually and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
